## `image-blaster`
Creates 3D environments, SFX, and meshes from a single image using portable pipeline scripts, World Labs, FAL, and thin adapters for agent shells.

Can take you from an image to a fully meshed 3D environment in < 5 minutes, great for jumpstarting 3D work. Go full blast.


## Quickstart

1. Open a Terminal, enter `git clone https://github.com/neilsonnn/image-blaster`
2. Enter the directory with `cd image-blaster`
3. Configure provider keys in your shell, including [World Labs](https://platform.worldlabs.ai/) and [FAL](https://fal.ai/).
4. Put an image into the `input/` directory.
5. Use an adapter in `adapters/`, or run the portable commands directly with `npm run ib:* --`.

Portable setup command:

```bash
npm run ib:preflight
npm run ib:project -- --world "my-world" --stage-input
```

`ib:preflight` reads `.env`, reports whether `WORLD_LABS_API_KEY` and `FAL_KEY` are present, and prints the rough cost envelope for each paid provider before generation.

### Description

By default `image-blaster` will use your input image to create:

1. 3D models (`.glb`, `.obj`) of all *dynamic* objects
2. Gaussian splat (`.ply`) of the *static* environment,
3. Ambient looping sound and object specific physics SFX (`.mp3`)

### Extensions

You can embed `image-blaster` under the assets of *any game engine, DCC software, or web app*.

1. Unity, Unreal, or Godot game engine
2. Blender, 3DS Max, or Maya or other DCC software
3. Three.js web app or Electron app

## Advanced

IMAGE-BLASTER uses a few generation models:

- `marble-1.1` - World Labs Marble model creates the explorable environment.
- `nano-banana` - default image edit preference for source cleanup, clean plates, and object reference images.
- `gpt-image-2` - alternate image edit provider when the edit skill is asked to prefer it.
- `hunyuan-3d` - Hunyuan 3D model creates 3D object models through FAL.
- `elevenlabs-sfx` - ElevenLabs sound effects model creates ambient and object-specific sounds.

World generation defaults to `.ply` splat exports for broader DCC and engine compatibility. If World Labs returns native PLY URLs, the pipeline downloads those directly; otherwise it converts the returned SPZ splats to PLY locally. Use `--splat-format spz` or `--splat-format both` when you explicitly need compressed SPZ artifacts.

3D model creation supports these Hunyuan parameters:

- `--face-count <40000-1500000>`: target face count. IMAGE-BLASTER defaults to `50000`; Hunyuan's API default is `500000`.
- `--enable-pbr true|false`: enable PBR material generation. Defaults to `true`.
- `--generate-type Normal|LowPoly|Geometry`: `Normal` creates a textured model, `LowPoly` applies polygon reduction, and `Geometry` creates a white geometry-only model. Defaults to `Normal`.
- `--polygon-type triangle|quadrilateral`: polygon type for `LowPoly`. Defaults to `triangle`.

### Examples

- Video game level concepts? `IMAGE-BLAST` it.
- Your childhood bedroom? `IMAGE-BLAST` it.
- Need an environment for a robot? `IMAGE-BLAST` it.
- A film location scout? `IMAGE-BLAST` it.
- An architectural rendering? `IMAGE-BLAST` it.

### Development

The core scripts live in `pipeline/`. Existing `.claude/` skills remain for backward compatibility, but new agent support should use `docs/agent-workflow.md` and `adapters/`.
